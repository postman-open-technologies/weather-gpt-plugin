This is a basic weather API that can be used to get limited information about a particular cities weather, local time, and what country that city is in. The API is built to support ChatGPT plugins and can be easily installed by anyone with plugin access on ChatGPT. 

**NOTE:** If you do not have plugin access on ChatGPT or want to make use of this as a plugin locally with generative AI capabilities, please make use of [BingChain](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/bingchain).
